  <h1>FRP state machine example with kefir.js</h1>
  <p>
    You walk into a casino with $20 in your pocket and decide to play some blackjack.

  <p>
    Each hand costs $5 - if you win, you get that much, if you lose, you lose that much.
  </p>

  <p>
    You and the dealer use the same playing strategy - hit on 16 or below, stay on 17 or above.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you make it up to $100 you'll walk away with a smile on your face.
    If you lose all your money you'll walk away too.  Without a smile.
  </p>

  <p>
    How will it turn out? <em>(Open the console to see the logs)</em>
